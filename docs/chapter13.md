Micropayment channels have been developed by many parties, and has been discussed on bitcointalk, the bitcoin mailing list, and IRC. The amount of contributors to this idea are immense and much thought have been put into this ability. Effort has been placed into citing and finding similar ideas, however it is absolutely not near complete. In particular, there are many similarities to a proposal by Alex Akselrod by using hashlocking as a method of encumbering a hub-and-spoke payment channel.

Thanks to Rusty Russell for reviewing this document and suggestions for making the concept more digestible, as well as working on a construction which may provide a stop-gap solution before a long-term malleability fix (to be described in a future version).
