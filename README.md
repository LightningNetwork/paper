# Compiling/Editing

Paper is in LaTeX format. Diagrams are in dia, but may remake the diagrams in
inkscape for cleanliness.

## Updating bibliography
If you're not familiar with latex, updating bibliography requires running:
```
pdflatex new.tex
bibtex new
pdflatex new.tex
pdflatex new.tex
```

## Generating figures
requires dia

```
cd figures
python dia2pdf.py
```

## Formatting

By default, there is a text width of 80 characters unless there is an explicit
need to go longer.

If you want to do formatting of paragraphs, the vim settings are:

```
:set tw=80
```

If you want to reflow text, it's
```
<ESC>gqj
```

If you want to reflow an entire paragraph, it's
```
<ESC>gq}
```

There are a couple places where reflowing will break (primarily in figures
where it's sensitive to linebreaks).
